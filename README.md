For all the graphics designers there,  to showcase your work and to get in touch with millions of users through app.

It's an open source project.
Easy yet elegant dashboard out there.
Very unique design and easy to use and bullshit craps.

Feel free to use the dashboard and don't forget to credit and support the devs who put lot of their efforts to bring this into action.

Try out the sample app [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwWQybffuHXNb296X2RxVldQaVE/view?usp=sharing).
